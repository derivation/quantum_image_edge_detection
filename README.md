# quantum_image_edge_detection
Using Qiskit to implement a quantum algorithm that detects edges in images.

edge_detection_demo.ipynb is a brief demonstration intended for a broad audience with little background in quantum computing.

edge_detection.ipynb is a long exploration for an audience with more experience in quantum computing.
